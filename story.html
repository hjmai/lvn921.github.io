									<h4>"I can do anything a boy can do."</h4>
									<p>As a young girl, I struggled with math. I noticed that the top math students in my classes were only boys. One day in third grade, I asked one of the boys for help and he told me, "You wouldn't get it because you're a girl." I didn't take this too well (as you can imagine). From then on, I studied the next level of math one summer ahead from  college textbooks that my mom found at swapmeeets. However difficult and dreadful my summers were, I had the motivation to outshine all of the boys in my class. I kept telling myself, "I can do anything a boy can do." It took some time, a few years to be exact. By the time I was in 8th grade, I finally was rewarded for my efforts with the highest academic math award for my grade in the district. I continued to excel in math throughout high school and college. It was not an easy feat. I would not describe my summers as "fun". I would not encourage to sacrifice your all of your childhood to excel in academics. However, a little effort and motivation goes a long way. </p>

									<h4>"Engineering isn't for girls."</h4>
									<p>I grew up in a traditional family where gender heavily influences what your future will be. Before I could even walk, my parents have decided that I would either be a doctor, a nurse, or a pharmacist. I personally could not keep up with biology. I actually wanted to be an artist. I love drawing and painting, but my parents would not agree with a career in art. My love for Disney, video games, and art influenced my dream on becoming an animator or something related to computer graphics. That meant I had to understand computers in order to create digital art. We only had 1 computer to share amongst the entire family and the internet wasn't really available, especially fast internet, so when I was deciding my major for college, I chose the next best thing: Computer Science and Engineering.</p> 

									<p>Why computer science? My oldest brother at the time was a computer science major and he showed me its potential. I knew then and there, that was a place to start. If you thought this was the end of it, you're wrong. If I could be this decisive at such a young age, I would go back in time to pat myself on the back. However, like everyone human being, doubt constantly crept in the back of my mind. My parents still insisted that I choose the biology track and that my brothers were more suited for doctors and engineers. They told me, that girls are supposed to choose something more..."lady-like", and engineering was something meant for boys because it requires more complex thinking. I had a hard time accepting this, but every day, I questioned my own potential.</p>
									<p></p>

									<h4>"I questioned my own potential every day."</h4>
									<p>Don't get me wrong, I love-love-love my parents. I am grateful for everything they have done for me. You can't blame them for thinking that the computer science is primarily better suited for men. I mean, a simple research would show that the ratio of men to women in software companies are a bit disappointing. If you're in a computer science class already, just looking around at your classmates gives you enough of an idea of how society has portrayed math and science to young girls. My mom, however, was one of my biggest inspirations for becoming an engineer. She was denied many jobs because no one could believe she could do a man's job. Till this day, she does not an official engineer title, but .</p>
